> __News:__ I am looking for PostDoc position starting from Summer 2024!

My research intersects climate change and human-environment interactions, with a special emphasis on environmental changes with urban area and wildland-urban interface (WUI). I am now concluding my Ph.D in the [Department of Geography at The Ohio State University](https://geography.osu.edu/), where I received my master's degree too. Before coming to OSU, I received my Bachelor's degree from the [Department of Remote Sensing Science & Technology at Wuhan University](https://rsgis.whu.edu.cn/).
