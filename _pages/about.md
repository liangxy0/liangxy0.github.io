> __News:__ I am looking for PostDoc position starting from Summer 2024!

My research interest is in computational methods for earth sciences, with a special emphasis on multiphase flow and transport for CO$_2$ geological storage, physics modeling, and machine learning. I obtained my Ph.D. from the [Energy Sciences & Engineering](https://earth.stanford.edu/ere) Department at [Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability](https://sustainability.stanford.edu/)
working with Professor [Sally M. Benson](https://earth.stanford.edu/people/sally-benson). I was an ExxonMobil Emerging Energy Fellow through the [Stanford Strategic Energy Alliance](https://news.stanford.edu/2018/03/01/new-energy-research-program-collaboration/). 


I received my Master's degree in Fluid Mechanics and Hydrology from Civil and Environmental Engineering at Stanford University. Prior to my Ph.D. at Stanford, I received my Bachelor's degree with honors from Lassonde Mineral Engineering at the University of Toronto and was nominated as [16 Grads to Watch](https://news.engineering.utoronto.ca/grads-watch-16-global-engineering-leaders/).
